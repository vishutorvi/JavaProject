                        Automatic Conversion of JSON to Relational Database Schema

Here is a project which converts Huge JSON objects which has redundant data, which we are converting into Relational Schema Database helpful in Both Data Analytics and removing of data redundancy.

This is the implementation for the Paper "Automatic Generation of Normalized Relational Schemas from Nested Key-Value Data", Authors are 	
Michael DiScala	Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, Daniel J. Abadi	Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.

To install and run this Project following steps should be followed:

1) We need Database, We used MySQL database, so we recommend to install MySQL database.
  To install mySQL database please follow the link: https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-install-mysql/ under Manual Installation section.
2) Create schema by name sampletable_demo in MySQL database.
3) If your listening port is other than 3306, Go to the file DatabaseConnections.java under 'src/com/uttara/connection'. change line 20 by
"jdbc:mysql://localhost:<YOUR_PORT_NUMBER>/sampletable_demo";

3) Download the complete package/you can directly use the Zip file, we have sample JSON file within the folder /src, this is a sample of 100 JSON Objects which is enough to test this project If complete dataset is required please follow the link:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3Mo6HBxuETXY2phSkdaeFJhZVU/view?usp=sharing

4) To use the above complete dataset, Please place this file under /src. Once it is placed, change the file by name JsonMainConverter.java 
under /src/com/uttara/info folder. Change line No 46, source from 'src/pullrequest_json_1.json' to 'src/pullrequestsdb.pull_requests.json'

5) We can use either Eclipse or Netbeans IDE to load this workspace folders and go to file JsonMainConverter.java, right click and run as Java Application.

Done!!

You can see new tables created in MYSQL database with primary foreign constraints attached.

To obtain Schema for this database, We need to do reverse engineering
    1) Go to MySQL WORKBENCH
    2) Select Database from menu bar.
    3) Click on Reverse Engineer
    4) Select the Database for which Schema needs to be generated. In my case it is (sampletable_demo).
